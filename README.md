## Questions
# Explain the meaning of Version Control
- Version control is way to manage files saving his state as a history telling, working this way, provides the possibility to track changes on files.
# Highlight a benefit of Version Control
- One benefit of using Version Control is the possibility of changing back to a previus version of a project being able to rolling back to a version of a software in case of it is causing a break down of the application due to some change in the code.
# Provide an application of Version Control. This means, provide an example of how Version Control could be used.
- You have a lot of database SQL procedures and scripts that should be executed on a creation of a new application, also you need to increment and change the application database with tables, procedures, triggers. Instead of saving it to a simple folder you use some application of Version Control to help you manage it.
# Show a command used in Version Control (for example a Git command)
- git status
# Thoroughly explain these concepts (this likely cannot be done in less than 100 words)
- Git status is used to represent the status of the files, and folders in a branch. This command can show you what files are currently being tracked in the actual repository, it shows which files have been staged (represented by green color), changed, or deleted, and also shows files that are not tracked (represented by red color),  or folders that are not tracked if you don't add these files that are untracked to your repository when you commit and push the files to the server, the untracked files will not go up to the Version Control Server. Otherwise, files and folders tracked gonna be sent to the server.
